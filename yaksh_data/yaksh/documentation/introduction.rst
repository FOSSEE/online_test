============

This project provides an "exam" app that lets users take an online programming quiz.


Features
--------
* Easy installation and cross platform support for Linux and Mac OS.
* Define fairly complicated programming problems and have users solve the problem.
* Immediate verification of code solution.
* Supports pretty much arbitrary coding questions in Python, C, C++, Java, Scilab and simple Bash and uses "test cases" to test the implementations of the students.
* Supports simple multiple choice questions, fill in the blanks questions and assignment evaluations.
* Since it runs on Python, you could technically test any Python based library.
* Completely safe from malicious code.
* Scales to over 500+ simultaneous users.
* Distributed under the BSD license.
