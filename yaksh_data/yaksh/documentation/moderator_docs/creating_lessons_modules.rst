Lessons and Modules
===================

Courses can have lessons and quizzes encapsulated using a module.

	* **What is a lesson?**
		A lesson can be any markdown text with/or an embedded video of a particular topic.

	* **What is a module?**
		A Module is a collection of lessons and courses clubbed together by similar idea/content. A module can have its own description as a markdown text with/or an embedded video.

	**Choosen Lesson and quizzes** contains all the lessons and quizzes that are added to a module.

	A lesson or quiz added to a module becomes a unit. A unit has following parameters to change:

			To change a unit's order change the value in the textbox under **Order** column and click **Change order**.

		**Check Prerequisite** - Check if previous unit is completed. Default value is **Yes**.
			For e.g. A student has to first complete **Yaksh Demo quiz** to attempt **Demo Lesson** if the **Check Prerequisite** value for **Demo Lesson** is checked **Yes**.

			**Currently** column shows the current value of **Check Prerequisite** which in this case is **Yes**.

			Select the checkbox from **Change** column under **Check Prerequisite** and click **Change Prerequisite** button to change the value.
